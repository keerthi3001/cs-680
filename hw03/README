# HW03 — Smart Thermostat (State Pattern)

Implements a thermostat with states: IDLE, HEATING, COOLING, AWAY (eco), OFF.
Behavior changes by state:
- temperatureMeasured(t) decides heat/cool/off
- setTarget(t) updates target
- awayOn/awayOff toggles eco band control
- powerLost/powerRestored handles outage

Design Notes
------------
Uses the State pattern to avoid if/else chains.
States encapsulate transitions and actions; the context (Thermostat) owns actuators.
Unit tests verify state transitions and actuator behavior.
